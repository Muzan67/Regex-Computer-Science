The basic international phone number validation

## Summary - The basic international phone number validation

A simple regex to validate string against a valid international phone number format without delimiters and with an optional plus sign:

### Anchors
Anchors have special meaning in regular expressions. They do not match any character. Instead, they match a position before or after characters:

 ^ – The caret anchor matches the beginning of the text.
 $ – The dollar anchor matches the end of the text.
