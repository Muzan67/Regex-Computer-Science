Developers write code, but they also write about code. For this assignment we search the web for tutorials that explains how a specific regular expression, or regex, functions by breaking down each part of the expression and describing what it does.

# What is a Regex?

A regex, which is short for regular expression, is a sequence of characters that defines a specific search pattern. When included in code or search algorithms, regular expressions can be used to find certain patterns of characters within a string, or to find and replace a character or sequence of characters within a string. They are also frequently used to validate input.
